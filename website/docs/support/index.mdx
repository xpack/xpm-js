# How to obtain help for xpm

## Quick links

The most efficient approach is to utilise the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/discussions)
pages.

## Web page issues

If you encounter any issues within the content of these pages (such as typographical errors or
incorrect phrasing) or have suggestions for improving the documentation,
please share them through the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/discussions)
pages.
Ensure you provide the full URL of the page, clearly identify the
section with the problematic content, and suggest improvements.

## Check documentation

As usual, before asking anything, it is advisable to review the project
documentation.

<ProjectDocumentation/>

## Preliminary checks

Before posting any questions or providing feedback,
verify whether the subject has not already been addressed.

- Check the [FAQ](/docs/faq/)
for similar problems
- Review the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/discussions) for
similar topics
- Examine the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/issues)
tracker and the
[GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/pulls)
for similar problems.

## Ask questions in GitHub Discussions

If you still cannot find a solution, have interesting use cases,
custom configurations, or any experiences you wish to share with
others, please 
utilise the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/discussions)
pages.
Initiate a **New discussion**; utilise the **Q&A** category for questions,
**Ideas** for suggestions and **General** for everything else.

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you have identified a bug
or wish to contribute code to enhance the
**xPack Project Manager**
project, register a **New Issue** in the
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/issues)
tracker.

:::caution

Please **do not** utilise the GitHub Issues tracker
for questions and support; instead, **utilise the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/discussions)** pages.

:::

## Stack Overflow

For community assistance, you may also utilise
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
Tag your questions with `xpack`.

:::tip

Please be aware that there is another tag `elastic-x-pack` for a different
project, and some of their questions are tagged with `xpack` as well.

:::

## The Discord channel

For live discussions amongst members, join the **xPack Community** on
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kbzWaJerFG).

Currently, there are several channels available:

- `#xpm`
- `#xcdl`
- `#xpack-dev-tools`
- `#general`

These channels are open for free discussions on their respective topics.

However, for support, please utilise GitHub Discussions whenever possible.

## X/Twitter

New releases and other announcements are posted on
[X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/xpack_project).

Follow the hashtag `#xpack_project` for the latest updates.

## Use of private email

:::caution Please, please, please!

**Do not** utilise
private email for support; instead, **utilise the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/discussions)** pages.

:::

Private messages will receive an automated reply containing a link
to this page. This approach is not intended to be discourteous, but
rather to optimise time efficiency; as discussions are archived,
others facing similar issues may benefit from the provided answers.
