## Prerequisites

Installing **xpm** requires:

- A recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (specified as "engines.node": ">=20.0.0")
- A recent version of [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) which is installed alongside Node.js

For those new to Node.js, it is highly recommended to read the instructions
on the [xPack Prerequisites](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

### Quick instructions

For those who have already completed the installation steps on the
[xPack Prerequisites](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page and are
familiar with the process, here are the necessary commands.
Simply copy and paste them into your terminal. When you hover the mouse
over the command, a **copy button** will appear on
the right side; click it to copy the command.

Download the Windows **Prebuilt Installer** (a `node-v*-x64.msi` file) from the
[Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)
page. Select the **latest LTS** version
and install it as usual, ensuring you have administrative rights.

:::tip

Unless specifically required, **refrain** from selecting the
**Tools for Native Modules** during installation, as this will
result in the installation of some very large Microsoft tools.

:::

Although not mandatory, it is recommended to update **npm** to the
latest version:

```txt
npm install -location=global npm@latest
```

Update the user `Path` and make it persistent:

```txt
set Path=%APPDATA%\npm;%Path%
setx Path "%APPDATA%\npm;%Path%"
```

Configure PowerShell to allow the execution of node.js applications:

```txt
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
```

To install **node** via the **nvm** version manager,
execute the following script in your shell:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xpack/assets/master/scripts/install-nvm-node-npm-xpm.sh | ${SHELL}

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

:::tip

This script not only installs **node** and **npm** but
also **xpm**, allowing you to safely skip the next section.
