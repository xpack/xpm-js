<summary>Reproducibility and `dependencies`</summary>

To ensure reproducibility, it is essential for each project to always
use the exact desired versions of the required libraries, regardless of the
libraries installed in the system.

To achieve this goal, **xpm** records all locally installed packages
as dependencies in the project `package.json` file.

The result looks like this:

<CodeBlock language="json"> {
`  "xpack": {
    "minimumXpmRequired": "0.20.7",
    "dependencies": {
      "xpm": {
        "specifier": "0.20.8",
        "local": "link",
        "platforms": "all"
      }
    },
    "devDependencies": {},
    "properties": {},
    "actions": {},
    "buildConfigurations": {}
  }
`} </CodeBlock>

If the `package.json` is saved in the revision system, the above
definition acts as a hard reference to the specific version of
the xPack Project Manager.

After cloning the project into a different location, the command `xpm install`
can be used to install all dependencies.

This is particularly useful for CI/CD environments.
