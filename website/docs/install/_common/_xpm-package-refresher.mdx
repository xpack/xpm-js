<summary>xpm packages (xPacks) refresher</summary>

**xpm packages**, abbreviated as **xPacks**, are general-purpose,
language-neutral software packages.
They utilise **the same format as npm packages**,
which comprises a collection of files/folders
and a `package.json` file with the package metadata.

**xpm** can install source and binary packages.

For more details, please refer to the previous explanation on the
[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/#xpm-packages) page.
