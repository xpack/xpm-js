## Release schedule

There are no fixed releases.

## Prepare the new releases

### Check Git

In the `xpack/xpm-js` Git repo:

- switch to the `development` branch
- pull new changes
- if necessary, **merge** the `master` branch
- if necessary, **merge** the `website` branch

:::caution

This is really important, otherwise the next steps will build again the previous release!

:::

The `master` branch should be unchanged since the previous release
and will be updated when the new release is out.

### Update npm packages

:::note

This package is also used by the VS Code extension and, until VS Code will
accept ESM dependencies, it must be
kept as a legacy CommonJS dependency.

:::

- `npm outdated`
- `npm update` or edit and `npm install`
- repeat and possibly manually edit `package.json` until everything is
  up to date
- **commit** the changes

<DependenciesDetails />

### Increase the version and update it in the top `package.json`

As required by npm modules, this one also uses [SemVer](https://semver.org).

- determine the next version (like <code>0.20.7</code>)
- update the version in the top `package.json` file
- use the new version, suffixed by `-pre`, like <code>0.20.7-pre</code>.

### Update the `websiteConfig` in top `package.json` (if necessary)

Check and possibly update the `websiteConfig`.

### Update the website commons

Run the `website-generate-commons` script in the top `package.json`;
this will also update the top README.md file.

### Start the local web server

Execute the npm script `clean` then `start` in the website sub-project,
or run the following in a terminal:

```sh
npm run clean
npm run start
```

Navigate to the **Maintainer Info** page,
the **Fix possible open issues** section.

### Fix possible open issues

Check GitHub Issues and Pull Requests:

- https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/issues
- https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/pulls

and fix them; assign them to a milestone
(like <code>0.20.7</code>).

### Update `CHANGELOG.md`

- open the `CHANGELOG.md` file
- check if all previous fixed issues are in
- check the latest commits `xpm run git-log`; if necessary, copy/paste lines,
  group by dates and edit them using the below regular expressions

- to turn the dates into headings, change from:

```txt


([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]) [*]
```

to:

```txt


## $1

*
```

- to remove the rest of the dates, change from:

```txt
^[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9] [*]
```

to:

```txt
*
```

- add a new entry like _**\* v0.20.7 prepared**_
- **commit** with a message like _**prepare v0.20.7**_

### Prepare the release

- terminate all running tasks (**Terminal** → **Terminate Task...**)
- switch to the `development` branch
- commit everything
- `npm run fix`
- if there are changes, **commit** all changes into the `development` branch
- `npm run test`
- `npm run pack`; check the list of packaged files, possibly
  update `.npmignore`
- **push** all changes to GitHub

### Set the new version

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`npm version 0.20.7
`} </CodeBlock>

### CI tests

- the `postversion` npm script should also update tags via
  `git push origin --tags`; this should trigger CI
- **wait for CI tests to complete**
- check https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/actions

## Prepare a new blog post

- check and possibly update the `website/blog/_templates/blog-post-release-liquid.mdx`
- run the `generate-website-blog-post` npm script; this will add a file in the `website/blog` folder:

```sh
npm run generate-website-blog-post
```

- edit the front matter properties
- select the correct summary
- **commit** with _**website: blog post release 0.20.7 published**_
- **push** the `development` branch

## Publish the release to npmjs.com

```sh
npm publish --tag next
```

- when publishing for the first time, use:

```sh
npm publish --access public
```

After a few moments the version will be visible at
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm?activeTab=versions">npmjs.com</a>,
the Versions tab.

### Manual install test

Test if the package can be installed globally:

```bash
npm install ----location=global xpm@next
```

Validate the web site content in a local build via the npm `build` script:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Prepare the website

The documentation site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and
published in the project
[GitHub Pages](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/).

- switch to the `development` branch
- run the `website-generate-commons` script in the top `package.json`
- **commit** all changes
- run the `build` script in `website/package.json`
- fix any broken links, if any

## Publish the website

The Web site deployment is performed automatically when pushing to the
`website` branch, by a dedicated workflow in
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/actions/workflows/publish-github-pages.yml).

- switch to the `website` branch
- **merge** the `development` branch into the `website` branch
- **push** the `website` branch to GitHub

At this moment an automated GitHub Action will generate and publish the website.

- the new release blog post is
in https://xpack.github.io/xpm/blog/
- remember the post URL, since it must be used to update the release page
and the X/Twitter announcement

The `website` branch may be subsequently updated, as long as the
version in `package.json` is not changed.

Check the result at https://xpack.github.io/xpm/.

## Final updates

### Update the `master` branch

In this Git repo:

- select the `master` branch
- **merge** the `development` branch into the `master` branch
- **push** the `master` branch to GitHub

### Close milestone

In https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/milestones:

- close the current milestone.

### Check npm package tags

```sh
npm dist-tag ls xpm
```

### Tag the npm package as `latest`

When the release is considered stable, promote it as `latest`:

<CodeBlock language="sh"> {
`npm dist-tag add xpm@0.20.7 latest
npm dist-tag ls xpm
`} </CodeBlock>

## Share on X/Twitter

- in a separate browser windows, open [X/Twitter](https://x.com/)
- using the `@xpack_project` account
- paste the release name like **xPack xpm v0.20.7 released**
- paste the link to the Web page
  [release](/docs/releases/)
