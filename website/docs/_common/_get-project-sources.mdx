git clone \
  --branch master \
  https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js.git \
  ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git
```

<summary>For development purposes, clone the `development` branch.</summary>

```sh
rm -rf ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git && \
mkdir -p ~/Work/xpack && \
git clone \
  --branch development \
  https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js.git \

Pull Requests back to the `development` branch.

## Add links for development

During development, it is convenient to maintain a writable instance of the
source code to enable changes in parallel with the parent project.

To facilitate the use of a writable instance of this source code in other
projects, add a link from the user's global npm store to this local
development folder:

```sh
npm --prefix ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git link
```

And in the projects referring it:

```sh
npm link xpm
```
