### Publish the website

The website deployment is performed automatically when pushing to the
`website` branch, by a dedicated workflow in
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/actions/workflows/publish-github-pages.yml).

- open https://xpack.github.io/xpm/docs/maintainer/#publish-the-website in a separate window
- stop the local web server
- switch to the `website` branch
- **merge** the `development` branch into the `website` branch
- **push** the `website` branch to GitHub
  :::info
  At this moment an automated GitHub Action will generate and publish the website.
  :::
- checkout the `development` branch
- wait for the publish to complete
- refresh the web page
- the new release blog post is
in https://xpack.github.io/xpm/blog/
- remember the post URL, since it must be used to update the release page
and the X/Twitter announcement

The `website` branch may be subsequently updated, as long as the
version in `package.json` is not changed.

Check the result at https://xpack.github.io/xpm/.
