The library undergoes continuous integration (CI) testing with every
push using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js/actions).
This ensures compatibility and stability across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
operating systems.

The tests are conducted on both 32-bit and 64-bit bare-metal platforms,
including Arm Cortex-M0, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4F, Cortex-M7F, Cortex-A15,
Cortex-A72, RISC-V RV32IMAC, and RV64IMAFDC. Additionally, native
testing is performed using GCC and LLVM/clang compilers, ensuring
thorough validation across various environments.
