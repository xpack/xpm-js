### Manual tests

There are predefined xpm actions available to manually execute various
tests on the local development machine.

It is recommended to commence by performing some clean-ups (not necessary
following the initial `git clone`):

```sh
npm --prefix ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests install
xpm run deep-clean -C ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests
```

:::tip

During the initial execution, the installation step may require a considerable
amount of time, as it needs to download the toolchain archives, which
can be relatively large, up to several hundred megabytes.

:::

To execute the tests with the system compiler (usually not available on Windows):

```sh
xpm run install -C ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests
xpm run test -C ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests
```

To execute a selection of tests with the latest versions of toolchains:

```sh
xpm run install-selected -C ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests
xpm run test-selected -C ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests
```

To execute all tests with the latest versions of toolchains:

```sh
xpm run install-latest -C ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests
xpm run test-latest -C ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests
```

To execute all tests with all toolchain versions:

```sh
xpm run install-all -C ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests
xpm run test-all -C ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests
```

### Clean-ups

Executing all tests may require several gigabytes of space.

To clean up the tests folder, utilise:

```sh
npm --prefix ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests install
xpm run deep-clean -C ~/Work/xpack/xpm-js.git/tests
```

A considerable amount of space may also be utilised by the toolchains.
When no longer required, they can be removed with `xpm uninstall`.
