**xpm** is a
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) CLI
application to automate builds and to manage
[xPacks](https://xpack.github.io/intro/#but-what-are-xpacks) dependencies.

## Install

**xpm** is a Node.js module that can be installed with `npm`.

For the prerequisites, since it is recommended
to use a version manager or to customize the **npm** install location,
please read the
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page for more details.

To install the **latest stable** version available, use:

```sh
npm uninstall --global xpm
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

To install this specific version, use:

```sh
xpm install --global xpm@{{ page.version }}
```

## Changes

The {{ page.version }} release
is generally compatible with previous releases.

### Bug fixes

- [#154] in certain conditions, downloading some archives silently failed;
  fixed, now error messages are shown
- [#159] when downloads fail, retry several times

### Enhancements

- none

### Other changes

- [#160] In case of errors, log.trace the full error object

### Known problems

- [#57] when multiple versions of the same package are referenced
  via different dependencies paths, the program fails; version
  mitigation will be implemented in a future release.
