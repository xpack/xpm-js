**xpm** is a
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) CLI
application to manage
[xPacks](https://xpack.github.io/intro/#but-what-are-xpacks) dependencies.

## Install

**xpm** is a Node.js module that can be installed with `npm`.

For the prerequisites, since it is recommended
to use a version manager or to customize the **npm** install location,
please read the
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page for more details.

To install the **latest stable** version available, use:

```sh
npm uninstall --global xpm
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

To install this specific version, use:

```sh
xpm install --global xpm@{{ page.version }}
```

## Changes

The {{ page.version }} release
is generally compatible with previous releases.

The main change is the bundling of dependencies to avoid the deprecation
warnings during install.

### Bug fixes

- [#112] in certain conditions, checking for updates failed due to network
  conditions, which were reported as errors; the logic was improved and these
  messages are now reported as warnings.

### Enhancements

- none.

### Other changes

- none.

### Known problems

- [#57] when multiple versions of the same package are referenced
  via different dependencies paths, the program fails; version
  mitigation will be implemented in a future release.

The program interprets `--help` and displays a top help page:

```console
% xpm --help
