## Overview

Initially **xpm** shared dependencies with **npm**, in the same top
`dependencies` and `devDependencies` properties.

The advantage was that **npm** aware tools and sites were able to list
these dependencies.

However, this required `xpm install` to also handle the **npm** dependencies,
which made things more complicated than they should have been.

## Changes

To simplify things, given that the xPack dependencies have a different
nature than node modules and require a different logic, it was considered
that it would be better to completely separate the definitions in
`package.json`, and move them below the `xpack` object.

Thus, for source and binary xPacks, starting with xpm v0.14.0,
the definitions are:

- `xpack.dependencies`
- `xpack.devDependencies`

## Action points

For a while, packages that have a `xpack.minimumXpmRequired` less than 0.14.0,
will still be able to use the shared definitions with npm,
but it is recommended to update the packages.

To do this, it is required to:

- update **xpm** to at least v0.14.0
- move xPack references from `dependencies` to `xpack.dependencies`
- move xPack references from `devDependencies` to `xpack.devDependencies`
- if any, keep the npm references in `dependencies` and `devDependencies`
- update `xpack.minimumXpmRequired` to at least 0.14.0
- add `npm install` to CI configurations (if needed)

## End-of-life

This policy is expected to remain available until the major rewrite of xpm,
planned for v1.0.0.
