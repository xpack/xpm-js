        Source libraries and binary packages can be added to projects
        as <b>dependencies</b>,
        and conveniently installed with <code>xpm install</code>.
        This feature also ensures reproducibility, which is particularly
        beneficial in <b>CI/CD</b> environments.

        The <b><Link to="https://xpack.github.io/xpm/">xpm</Link></b> CLI tool
        complements <b><Link to="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/">npm</Link></b> with
        several extra features specific to <b>C/C++ projects</b>.
        This enables source libraries and
        binary packages to nicely integrate into the Node.js ecosystem,
        while still allowing them to be installed manually.
